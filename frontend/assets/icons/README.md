# PWA Icons

The PWA manifest is configured to use properly sized PNG icons, but they need to be created manually.

## Required Icon Sizes

Please create the following PNG icons from the original-logo.jpg:

- icon-72x72.png

## Important Tips for Sharp Icons

1. Use PNG format (not JPEG) for better quality with transparency
2. Make sure each icon is exactly the specified size (e.g., 72x72 pixels)
3. Use high-quality resizing algorithms to avoid blurriness
4. Ensure the icon has good contrast against both light and dark backgrounds
5. Consider adding a small padding around the logo within the icon
